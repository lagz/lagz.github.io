### About Me

I am a Computer Engineering and Computer Science student at Kettering University with a serious passion for embedded systems. During school semesters I am an Undergraduate Researcher where under Dr. Zadeh of the ECE department I assist in the development of various systems for Kettering University's IGVC team. I am currently employed with Southwest Research Institute as a Student Engineer with a focus on real-time embedded linux development. 

### Freelance Work

My most recent freelance job was a really interesting device for film-maker in NYC. It is definitely not the most aesthetically pleasing design and the code leaves quite a bit to be desired but it gets the job done. [Check it out here](https://github.com/lagz/Surface-Disconformity-Measurement)

### Senior Design Project

For a Computer Engineering Senior Design project, my team developed a bluetooth foot-traffic scanner that estimated the population of a given area by tracking bluetooth signals. This was a really fun project to be a part of and recieved perfect scores on almost all of the evaluation criteria. [Check it out here](https://github.com/lagz/Bluetooth-Traffic-Scanner)
